## Design:
The main colors, based on the [Material Design Color Palettes](https://github.com/AmoebeLabs/Material-Design-Theme-Colors) are:
- Almost Black Teal for backgrounds
- Teal as Primary Color
- Teal as the Secondary Color

## Inspired by...
Of course, I did not re-invent the wheel.
Hemera and Nyx, together with the 3-grid layout and on/off colors are heavily inspred by Apple's HomeKit and the mighty [HomeBridge UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-config-ui-x#accessory-control).
